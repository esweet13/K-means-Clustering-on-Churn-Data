# K-means-Clustering-on-Churn-Data

INTRODUCTION

In this task, you will act as an analyst and create a data mining report. In doing so, you must select one of the data dictionary and data set files to use for your report from the following link: Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries.

You should also refer to the data dictionary file for your chosen dataset from the provided link. You will use Python or R to analyze the given data and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Throughout the submission, you must visually represent each step of your work and the findings of your data analysis.

SCENARIO

One of the most critical factors in customer relationship management that directly affects a company’s long-term profitability is understanding its customers. When a company can better understand its customer characteristics, it is better able to target products and marketing campaigns for customers, resulting in better profits for the company in the long term.

You are an analyst for a telecommunications company that wants to better understand the characteristics of its customers. You have been asked to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze customer data to identify the principal variables of your customers, ultimately allowing better business and strategic decision-making.

REQUIREMENTS

Part I: Research Question

A. Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:
1. Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using one
of the following clustering techniques: • k-means
• hierarchical
2. Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.

Part II: Technique Justification

B. Explain the reasons for your chosen clustering technique from part A1 by doing the following:
1. Explain how the clustering technique you chose analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected
outcomes.
2. Summarize one assumption of the clustering technique.
3. List the packages or libraries you have chosen for Python or R, and justify how each item on the list
supports the analysis.

Part III: Data Preparation

C. Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following
1. Describe one data preprocessing goal relevant to the clustering technique from part A1.
2. Identify the initial dataset variables that you will use to perform the analysis for the clustering
question from part A1, and label each as continuous or categorical.
3. Explain each of the steps used to prepare the data for the analysis. Identify the code segment for each
step.
4. Provide a copy of the cleaned dataset.

Part IV: Analysis

D. Perform the data analysis and report on the results by doing the following:
1. Describe the analysis technique you used to appropriately analyze the data. Include screenshots of the
intermediate calculations you performed.
2. Provide the code used to perform the clustering analysis technique from part 2.

Part V: Data Summary and Implications

E. Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:
1. Explain the accuracy of your clustering technique.
2. Discuss the results and implications of your clustering analysis.
3. Discuss one limitation of your data analysis.
4. Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your
results and implications discussed in part E2.
